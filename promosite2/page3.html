	<h1>Nano Spiders</h1>
	<p>
		Two spiders are walking along a track – a seemingly ordinary 
		scene, but these are no ordinary spiders. They are molecular 
		robots and they, like the tracks they stride over, are fashioned 
		from DNA. One of them has four legs and marches over its DNA 
		landscape, turning and stopping with no controls from its human
		creators. The other has four legs and three arms – it walks 
		along a miniature assembly line, picking up three pieces of 
		cargo from loading machines (also made of DNA) and attaching 
		them to itself. All of this is happening at the nanometre 
		scale, far beyond what the naked eye can discern. Welcome 
		to the exciting future of nanotechnology.
		The two robots are the stars of two new papers that describe
		the latest advances in making independent, programmable 
		nano-scale robots out of individual molecules. Such creations
		have featured in science-fiction stories for decades, from 
		Michael Crichton’s Prey to Red Dwarf, but in reality, there 
		are many barriers to creating such machines. For a start, 
		big robots can be loaded with masses of software that guides
		their actions – no such luck at the nano-level. 
		The two new studies have solved this problem by programming 
		the robots’ actions into their environment rather than their 
		bodies. Standing on the shoulders of giants, both studies fuse
		two of the most interesting advances in 
		nanotechnology: the design of DNA machines.
