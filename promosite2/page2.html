	<h1>Nanotechnology</h1>
	<p>
		is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. 
		The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the 
		particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules 
		for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular 
		nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was 
		subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which 
		defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one 
		dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the 
		fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm 
		scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal 
		to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies
		that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the 
		given size threshold.Although modern nanoscience and nanotechnology are 
		quite new, nanoscale materials were used for centuries. Alternate-sized 
		gold and silver particles created colors in the stained glass windows of
		medieval churches hundreds of years ago. The artists back then just 
		didnâ€™t know that the process they used to create these beautiful works 
		of art actually led to changes in the composition of the materials they 
		were working with.
