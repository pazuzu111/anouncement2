	<h1>Cybernetic Organisms</h1>
	<p>A cyborg is a being with both organic 
	   and biomechatronic body parts. 

	   The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic, biorobot or android; it 
	   applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities 
	   due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that 
	   relies on some sort of feedback. While cyborgs are commonly thought of
	   as mammals, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of 
	   organism.
	   the physical attachments humanity has with even the most basic technologies 
	   have already made them cyborgs. In a typical example, a human with an 
	   artificial cardiac pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator would
	   be considered a cyborg, since these devices measure voltage potentials in 
	   the body, perform signal processing, and can deliver electrical stimuli, 
	   using this synthetic feedback mechanism to keep that person alive. Implants, 
	   especially cochlear implants, that combine mechanical modification with any 
	   kind of feedback response are also cyborg enhancements. Some theorists cite 
	   such modifications as contact lenses, hearing aids, or intraocular lenses as
	   examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological 
	   capabilities.Some theorists cite. 
	   The future is here!!! look forward and think now.
